``` Introduction : I've Started My infosec Journey in ending of 2017 as a Partime Hobby , at first I got into Bug Bounty and Learnt about Application Security , So testing  Applications was merged as my daily Todo Fun which is filled with joy and excitment. '''

Internet is filled with tons of application each Application resembles a brain who designed them and testing every application is like communicating with those Intelligent toughts and learning from them to build Understand the flow of Application .  

MY FIRST PENTEST :

The First Application that I've Got to test is which Belongs to  my Friend , It was a Holiday I was Working on my College Project and on other hand I started testing the application as Normally I mapped the application to understand the flow of the application . while following the flow gradullay i got to knew the list of functionalities.

This is How i found my first XSS :

``` Note : Wappalyzer always comes handy to Identify the Old version Libraries are already tagged with some cve's. ```

There was a Functionality in Web Application where  users can Design an Instant Application with Project Name . so
I Passed XSS Payload in Input Fields of project name as the Result the Application assigned with the Porject Name which Triggered XSS (STORED XSS)

                                ![Creating an Applicaion ](/assets/app.jpg)

OBSERVATION :

so here the main things  that i observed is  the project application  name ,  which is passed  by user is reflecting back
and soon i have seen that an I Frame is created after building an application so i tried following payload : 
                               
                                 <iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain)> 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 ![Creating an Applicaion ](/assets/xss.jpg)
            
            
            
             Just wait i havent finished yet there is another finding that i want to share
