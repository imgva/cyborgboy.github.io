## Introduction :  
I've Started My infosec Journey in year of 2017 as a Partime Hobby , at first I got into Bug Bounty and Learnt about Application Security , So testing  Applications was merged as my daily Todo Fun which is filled with joy and excitment.

Internet is filled with tons of application each Application resembles a brain who designed them and testing every application is like communicating with those Intelligent toughts and learning from them to build Understand the flow of Application .  

MY FIRST PENTEST :

The First Application that I've Got to test is which Belongs to  my Friend , It was a Holiday I was Working on my College Project and on other hand I started testing the application as Normally I mapped the application to understand the flow of the application . while following the flow gradullay i got to knew the list of functionalities.

This is How i found my first XSS :

``` Note : Wappalyzer always comes handy to Identify the Old version Libraries are already tagged with some cve's. ```

There was a Functionality in Web Application where  users can Design an Instant Application with Project Name . so
I Passed XSS Payload in Input Fields of project name as the Result the Application assigned with the Porject Name which Triggered XSS (STORED XSS)

OBSERVATION :

so here the main things  that i observed is  the project application  name ,  which is passed  by user is reflecting back
and soon i have seen that an I Frame is created after building an application so i tried following payload 
<center> <div id="content"> <iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain)> </div></center>
<img src="/cyborgboy.github.io/assets/alert.jpg">

                                 
Just wait i havent finished yet there is another finding that i want to share 
## Here How I Found Open Git Direcoty leaking Sensitive Files 

Here I detailed about the  journey from  amazon open bucket to hidden git folder as it looks like magic my day started with a password reset email it was morning and i have forgotten the password for the my account . so i requested for a password reset email . I landed up with this one

This was the Password Reset Link in email which has broken HTML Content with Password Reset Link . unexpectedly The Broken HTML Image Leaking out the Amazon S3 bucket storage Location

``` Note: It is better to check the image Location to find where it is loading from ```

Quickly without thinking i fired up my terminal > aws client and pushed an xss file to bucket but it rejected with permission denied :( but after seeing all list of folder there i found the path to git folder
