&lt;p&gt;I’ve Started My infosec Journey in year of 2017 as a Partime Hobby , at first I got into Bug Bounty and Learnt about Application Security , So testing  Applications was merged as my daily Todo Fun which is filled with joy and excitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet is filled with tons of application each Application resembles a brain who designed them and testing every application is like communicating with those Intelligent toughts and learning from them to build Understand the flow of Application .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY FIRST PENTEST :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Application that I’ve Got to test is which Belongs to  my Friend , It was a Holiday I was Working on my College Project and on other hand I started testing the application as Normally I mapped the application to understand the flow of the application . while following the flow gradullay i got to knew the list of functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is How i found my first XSS :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Note : Wappalyzer always comes handy to Identify the Old version Libraries are already tagged with some cve's.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Functionality in Web Application where  users can Design an Instant Application with Project Name . so
I Passed XSS Payload in Input Fields of project name as the Result the Application assigned with the Porject Name which Triggered XSS (STORED XSS) 
          &lt;center&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/Blog/assets/app.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OBSERVATION :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so here the main things  that i observed is  the project application  name ,  which is passed  by user is reflecting back
and soon i have seen that an I Frame is created after building an application so i tried following payload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain)&amp;gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Blog/assets/alert.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wait i havent finished yet there is another finding that i want to share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-how-i-found-open-git-direcoty-leaking-sensitive-files&quot;&gt;Here How I Found Open Git Direcoty leaking Sensitive Files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I detailed about the  journey from  amazon open bucket to hidden git folder as it looks like magic my day started with a password reset email it was morning and i have forgotten the password for the my account . so i requested for a password reset email . I landed up with this one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/Blog/assets/email.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the Password Reset Link in email which has broken HTML Content with Password Reset Link . unexpectedly The Broken HTML Image Leaking out the Amazon S3 bucket storage Location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Blog/assets/shocking.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Note: It is better to check the image Location to find where it is loading from&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly without thinking i fired up my terminal &amp;gt; aws client and pushed an xss file to bucket but it rejected with permission denied :( but after seeing all list of folder there i found the path to git folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-06/4/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-13120-1401894225-26.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;soon i have started git dumper and cloned all there git folder  after that i have checked for some files and found some of important directories&lt;/p&gt;
